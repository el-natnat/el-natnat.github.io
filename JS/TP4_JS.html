  Here is a sample code for using a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Utilisation_des_web_workers" >Web Worker</a>. In short, Web Workers are a simple means for web content to run scripts in background threads. 
</p>
<p>
  Here the task is to multiply 2 members : when one of the field text is changed, the web worker is notified and perform its (background) task.
</p>
<p>
  Notice that web workers have workspace of their own. They cannot access directly the DOM neither. In order to pass parameters to and from the web worker, a messaging mecanism is used. 
</p>



	 <form>
        <div>
          <label for="number1">Multiply number 1: </label>    
          <input type="text" id="number1" value="0">
        </div>
        <div>
          <label for="number2">Multiply number 2: </label>   
          <input type="text" id="number2" value="0">
        </div>
      </form>

      <p class="result">Result: 0</p>

  <script src="main.js"></script>

  <h1>What do I expect from you? (ask for a live demo)</h1>
  <p>
  Create a web worker that will produce random 2D coordinates at random time (with mean time = 1sec). The webpage should display a red spot at those coordinates.
  </p>
  <p>
  Then, create 10 web workers that will produce random 2D coordinates at random time (with mean time = 1sec). The webpage should display a  spot at those coordinates with a different color for each web worker. You must used Object Oriented Programming.
